# Input Data File

#
# Set Frequencies
#
# F a b
# a = sampling frequency, Hz
# b = IF centre, Hz
#
# Specify Satellite Search
#
# S a b ...
# a = either 99 -> perform cold search for all satellites,
#     or number of PRN's specified in subsequent list
# b = If a is not 99, the first PRN to search for
# c = If a is not 99, the second PRN to search for
# d ... etc
#
# Use Ephemeris File
#
# E a
# a = 1-> use existing fastgps_ephemeris_log.dat

# Processing Time

# T a
# a = processing time, seconds

# Tracking Loop Gains and Intervals (See Paul Groves book for details)

# G a b c d e f g h i 
# a = FLL switch time (ms), default 500

# Aiding Information
#
# A a b c filename
# a = acquisition on-off flag, 0-> OFF, 1->ON
# b = GPS week of aiding file.
# c = GPS day of week of the aiding file.
# filename = filename (incl path) of the sp3 data file
#       notes: data being processing must be taken on same week and day as file if this is to work.
#              file must also be in 'old' sp3 _a_ format, use conversion utility included if needed.
